### Startup Description
Mini word games like crosswords, wordsearches, have seen a recent growth in popularity as newspaper companies like the New York Times and 
the The Washington Post. Even LinkedIn has integrated some word games into their app. crosswords and other words games have been around 
for a long time, but their recent emergence is likely due to newspaper companies transitioning the games from their traditional printed format
to websites and mobile apps. In my personal opinion the NYT has done this the best, presenting word games in an clean, simple app available on IOS and Android. New games are posted every day which keeps people coming back every day for more. My wife plays these games religiously every night.  

One game that I personally would like to see implemented on the NYT app is the "alphabet game", though it may go by other names. Basically you are given a topic, and must think of a word that fits into that topic for every letter in the alphabet. Like the NYT games it is simple, fun, and 
mentally stimulating in a positive way. Since this game isn't provided anywhere I'm going to undertake the task of developing it myself. 
Since the most user friendly way to present the game is in my opinion a mobile app, the web application I design for the game will be targeted 
towards mobile phone screen sizes so that users can have a similarly clean and hassle free experience.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever played the New York Times word games? Word games like this are growing in popularity and big companies like the NYT, Washington Post and even LinkedIn have jumped on the word game train. The word games are fun, mentally stimulating, and short, which makes them perfect for a 2 minute break from work, waiting at the bus stop, or playing right before bed. With the busy lives people lead nowadays a short game like this fits perfectly into everyones schedule. One game that is a personal favorite that I and others would like to see imlemented is the alphabet game. In the alphabet game you are given a topic and must find one word that starts with each letter of the alphabet that fits in the given topic. The game has lots of potential in the way it is presented. For example it could be played as a time race against another opponent, as a team game where two or more members alternate thinking of words for the different letters of the alphabet, or it could be points-based where for a given set of time, more points are given for more complicated words. If the game is presented as a web application in a mobile-phone friendly format, it could become extremely popular across the nation and the world.

### Design

shown above is the format of the NYT game. Desirable traits to emulate are the clean and simple interface, the lack of ads (although ads are displayed between games) and the ability to switch between light and dark mode

### Key features

- Users log into account to keep track of scores, history, and to compete with other players
- Users play the "alphabet game" by listing words that start with each letter of the alphabet that have to do with that days topic
- There is a new topic every day, and the list of words is either extensive or open to interpretation by a AI model of choice
    - I don't want to have to manually create lists of words under a given topic. at least not at this phase in the applications development
- Users can compete against eachother to finish the game the fastest

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - main structure of all webpages will use HTML
- **CSS** - creating the clean, modern look from NYT games will be done using CSS
- **React** - going from login page to main gameplay to leaderboard will be done using React routing
- **Service** - I may implement multiple local services for various tasks. 
                as for the third party service I'll probably use [one of the following](notes.md#web-api-for-word-generationchecking) to generate lists of words for a given topic.

                 
- **DB/Login** - ability for users to log into their account so they can view their high scores and such
- **WebSocket** - play against your friends in realtime. two "current letter progress" blocks will be displayed at the top of the screen. one for you and one for a friend you're playing against
